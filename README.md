# Par but not in C
Various implementations of [par](https://bitbucket.org/amc-nicemice/par/src/master/test-par) but not in C. The `par` command formats paragraphs, see [man page](https://manpages.org/par).

The idea is to rewrite `par` in many languages as an continuous exercise to explore the languages and have a useful solution that formats a paragraph in a great way.
